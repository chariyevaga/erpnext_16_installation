Drop your custom app folders here (one folder per app).

Example:
custom-apps/
  clefincode_chat/
  my_custom_app/

These folders will be copied into the image at build time and installed
automatically when the image builds.

You can also install extra apps from Git URLs by setting EXTRA_APPS in .env.
